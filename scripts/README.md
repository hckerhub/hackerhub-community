This directory contains useful automation scripts, tools, and utilities contributed by the community.

## What Goes Here

- **Reconnaissance Scripts** - Automated enumeration and discovery tools
- **Automation Tools** - Scripts to streamline repetitive tasks
- **Helper Utilities** - Useful functions and one-liners
- **Custom Exploits** - Educational proof-of-concept scripts
- **Data Processing** - Scripts for parsing and analyzing security data

## Contribution Guidelines

1. **Educational Purpose Only** - All scripts must be for learning and authorized testing
2. Include clear documentation and usage examples
3. Add safety warnings and ethical usage notes
4. Test thoroughly before submitting
5. Use descriptive filenames and include language extensions
6. Follow the template in `/CONTRIBUTING.md`
